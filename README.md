QSpectra: Nonlinear Spectroscopy for Molecular Aggregates
=========================================================

QSpectra is a Python package designed for flexible and fast calculation of
non-linear spectroscopy signals with novel types of dynamics.

To use any of the provided methods for calculating non-linear spectroscopy
signals, new theoretical methods for propagating dynamics need only specify free
evolution, how to apply system-field coupling operators and the ground state,
and QSpectra takes care of the rest.
