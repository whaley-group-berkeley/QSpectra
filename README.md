Nonlinear Spectroscopy and Dynamics of Molecule Aggregates
================================

*NAME* is a Python package designed for flexible and fast calculation of
non-linear spectroscopy signals with novel types of dynamics. To use any of the
provided methods for calculating non-linear spectroscopy signals, new
theoretical methods for propagating dynamics need only specify free evolution,
how to apply system-field coupling operators and the ground state, and *NAME*
takes care of the rest.
